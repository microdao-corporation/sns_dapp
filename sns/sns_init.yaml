    summary: |
        **I. Vision and Purpose**

        Windoge98 is an ecosystem project that was released in November 2023. Since then, it has grown into the largest "memecoin" project on the Internet Computer. Windoge98 has chosen the SNS route primarily for the following reasons:
        - It provides us an easily upgradable, standardized, and secure token ledger.
        - Additional security for our $2 million USD+ in various assets such as liquidity pools and treasury.
        - Provides a DAO system allowing us to easily gather community consensus.
        - Allows us to decentralize our apps.
        - Allows us to sell a small amount of treasury in the launchpad sale to increase our operating budget.

        **II. Token Distribution**

        *Token Details:*

        * Token name: Windoge98
        * Token symbol: EXE
        * Total token supply: 19,980,000,000 EXE
        * Token distribution: 99% treasury, 1% decentralization sale
        * SNS ledger transaction fee: 0.0001 EXE
        * Windoge98 dApp canister: 5ceyv-syaaa-aaaag-qc43q-cai

        Important note regarding token distribution! 

        The 99% treasury, 1% decentralization sale is the starting distribution specified by the SNS initialization parameters. 
        Because there is already an existing OLD Windoge98 token in circulation which will be convertible 1:1998 (minus transaction fees) to the NEW Windoge98 DAO token created for the SNS, the following will end up becoming the actual allocation:

        14% treasury, 1% decentralization sale, 83.6% EXE converter dApp, and about 1.4% Burned. 

        The reason is that a majority of the NEW Windoge98 DAO tokens in the treasury will be sent to the Windoge98 converter dApp, so that holders of the OLD Windoge98 token can convert them to the NEW Windoge98 DAO token. 
      
        **III. Governance and Token Management**

        Post-sale, the Windoge98 Team will propose a series of actions:
        * Burn a corresponding amount of NEW EXE DAO tokens as have been burnt from the OLD Windoge98 token supply (about 1.4% of total supply).
        * Send remaining amount minus treasury (84%) of NEW Windoge98 DAO tokens to the token swap canister to allow users to convert from the old token to the new token.

        *Governance Parameters:*

        * Minimum stake: 1 EXE
        * Minimum dissolve delay for voting: 2 Weeks
        * Maximum dissolve delay for bonus: 1 Year

Voting:
    # The minimum dissolve delay a neuron must have to be able to cast votes on
    # proposals.
    #
    # Dissolve delay incentivizes neurons to vote in the long-term interest of
    # an SNS, as they are rewarded for longer-term commitment to that SNS.
    #
    # Users cannot access the SNS tokens used to stake neurons (until the neuron
    # is dissolved). This field is specified as a duration. For example: "6 months".
    minimum_dissolve_delay: 2 weeks

    # Configuration of voting power bonuses that are applied to neurons to
    # incentivize alignment with the best interest of the DAO. Note, these
    # bonuses multiply each other, so the increase in voting power due to
    # the dissolve delay bonus is used in the equation to increase voting
    # power for the age bonus.
    MaximumVotingPowerBonuses:
        # Users with a higher dissolve delay are incentivized to take the
        # long-term interests of the SNS into consideration when voting. To
        # reward this long-term commitment, this bonus can be set to a
        # percentage greater than zero, which will result in neurons having
        # their voting power increased in proportion to their dissolve delay.
        #
        # For example, if the user has a dissolve delay of 6 months, and
        # the maximum dissolve delay duration (defined below as `duration`)
        # for the dissolve delay bonus is 12 months, and the maximum bonus
        # (defined as `bonus` below) is set to 10%, then that userâ€™s voting
        # power will be 105% of their normal voting power based on staked
        # tokens (i.e. they will have a bonus of 5%). If the user increased
        # their dissolve delay to 9 months, they would get 107.5% of the normal
        # voting power of their tokens. And if they increased to 12 months, they
        # would get 110%. If they increase further, they get no additional bonus.
        #
        # If you do not want this bonus to be applied for neurons with higher
        # dissolve delay, set `bonus` to `0%` and those neurons will not receive
        # higher voting power.
        DissolveDelay:
            # This parameter sets the maximum dissolve delay a neuron can have.
            # When reached, the maximum dissolve delay bonus will be applied.
            # This field is specified as a duration. For example: "8 years".
            duration: 3 months
            # If a neuron's dissolve delay is `duration`, its voting power will
            # be increased by the dissolve delay `bonus` amount. 
            # This field is specified as a percentage. For instance, 
            # a value of "100%" means that the voting power will be doubled
            # (multiplied by 2).
            bonus: 100%

        # Users with neurons staked in the non-dissolving state for a long
        # period of time are incentivized to take the long-term interests of
        # the SNS into consideration when voting. To reward this long-term
        # commitment, this bonus can be set to a percentage (greater than zero),
        # which will result in neurons having their voting power increased in
        # proportion to their age.
        #
        # For example, if the neuron has an age of 6 months, and the maximum age
        # duration (defined below as `duration`) for the age bonus is 12 months,
        # and the maximum bonus (defined as `bonus` below) is set to 10%, then
        # that neuronâ€™s voting power will be 105% of their normal voting power
        # based on staked tokens plus dissolve delay bonus (i.e. they will have a
        # bonus of 5%). If neuron aged another 3 months to have an age of 9 months,
        # the neuron would get 107.5% of the normal voting power. And if the neuron
        # aged another 3 months to 12 months, the neuron would get 110%. If the neuron
        # ages further, it get no additional bonus.
        #
        # If this bonus should not be applied for older neurons, set the bonus
        # to `0%` and older neurons will not receive higher voting power.
        Age:
            # This parameter sets the duration of time the neuron must be staked
            # in the non-dissolving state, in other words its `age`, to reach
            # the maximum age bonus. Once this age is reached, the neuron will
            # continue to age, but no more bonus will be applied. This field
            # is specified as a duration. For example: "2 years".
            duration: 1 year
            # If a neuron's age is `duration` or older, its voting power will be
            # increased by this age`bonus` amount. 
            # This field is specified as a percentage. For instance, 
            # a value of "25%" means that the voting power will increase by a quarter
            # (multiplied by 1.25).
            bonus: 100%

    # Configuration of SNS voting reward parameters.
    #
    # The voting reward rate controls how quickly the supply of the SNS token
    # increases. For example, setting `initial` to `2%` will cause the supply to
    # increase by at most `2%` per year. A higher voting reward rate
    # incentivizes users to participate in governance, but also results in
    # higher inflation.
    #
    # The initial and final reward rates can be set to have a higher reward rate
    # at the launch of the SNS and a lower rate further into the SNSâ€™s lifetime.
    # The reward rate falls quadratically from the `initial` rate to the `final`
    # rate over the course of `transition_duration`.
    #
    # Setting both `initial` and `final` to `0%` will result in the system not
    # distributing voting rewards at all.
    #
    # More details on SNS tokenomics can be found in the developer documentation:
    # https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/integrations/sns/tokenomics/rewards/#voting-rewards
    RewardRate:
        # The initial reward rate at which the SNS voting rewards will increase
        # per year. This field is specified as a percentage. For example: "15%".
        initial: 0%

        # The final reward rate at which the SNS voting rewards will increase
        # per year. This rate is reached after `transition_duration` and remains
        # at this level unless changed by an SNS proposal. This field is
        # specified as a percentage. For example: "5%".
        final: 0%

        # The voting reward rate falls quadratically from `initial` to `final`
        # over the time period defined by `transition_duration`.
        #
        # Values of 0 result in the reward rate always being `final`.
        #
        # This field is specified as a duration. For example: "8 years".
        transition_duration: 0 years

# Configuration of the initial token distribution of the SNS. You can configure
# how SNS tokens are distributed in each of the three groups:
# (1) tokens that are given to the original developers of the dapp,
# (2) treasury tokens that are owned by the SNS governance canister, and
# (3) tokens which are distributed to the decentralization swap participants.
#
# The initial token distribution must satisfy the following preconditions to be
# valid:
#    - The sum of all developer tokens in E8s must be less than `u64::MAX`.
#    - The Swap's initial balance (see group (3) above) must be greater than 0.
#    - The Swap's initial balance (see group (3) above) must be greater than or
#      equal to the sum of all developer tokens.
Distribution:
    # The initial neurons created when the SNS Governance canister is installed.
    # Each element in this list specifies one such neuron, including its stake,
    # controlling principal, memo identifying this neuron (every neuron that
    # a user has must be identified by a unique memo), dissolve delay, and a
    # vesting period. Even though these neurons are distributed at genesis,
    # they are locked in a (restricted) pre-initialization mode until the
    # decentralization swap is completed. Note that `vesting_period` starts
    # right after the SNS creation and thus includes the pre-initialization mode
    # period.
    #
    # For example:
    #  - principal: hpikg-6exdt-jn33w-ndty3-fc7jc-tl2lr-buih3-cs3y7-tftkp-sfp62-gqe
    #    stake: 1_000 tokens
    #    memo: 0
    #    dissolve_delay: 2 years
    #    vesting_period: 4 years
    Neurons:
        # For the actual SNS launch, you should replace this with one or more
        # principals of your intended genesis neurons.
        #
        # For testing, propose_sns.sh will fill this in automatically.

        # increased by `interval` compared to the previous one. For example,

        # participant's neuron basket will have three neurons (with equal stake)
        # with dissolve delays zero, 1 month, and 2 months. Note that the notion

    # Absolute time of day when the decentralization swap is supposed to start.
    #
    # An algorithm will be applied to allow at least 24 hours between the time
    # of execution of the CreateServiceNervousSystem proposal and swap start.
    # For example, if start_time is 23:30 UTC and the proposal is adopted and
    # executed at 23:20 UTC, then the swap start will be at 23:30 UTC the next
    # day (i.e., in 24 hours and 10 min from the proposal execution time).
    #
    # WARNING: Swap start_time works differently on mainnet and in testing.
    #
    # On mainnet:
    # - Setting start_time to some value (e.g., 23:30 UTC) will allow the swap
    #   participants to be prepared for the swap in advance, e.g.,
    #   by obtaining ICPs that they would like to participate with.
    # - If start_time is not specified, the actual start time of the swap will
    #   be chosen at random (allowing at least 24 hours and less than 48 hours,
    #   as described above).
    #
    # In testing:
    # - Setting start_time to some value works the same as explained above.
    # - If start_time is not specified, the swap will begin immediately after
    #   the CreateServiceNervousSystem proposal is executed. This facilitates
    #   testing in an accelerated manner.
    #
    # start_time: 23:30 UTC  # Intentionally commented out for testing.

    # The duration of the decentralization swap. When `start_time` is calculated
    # during CreateServiceNervousSystem proposal execution, this `duration` will
    # be added to that absolute time and set as the swap's deadline.
